Here is a solution which developed base on a local company code challenge(Didar crm)</br>
The challenge was designing a restful web api wich receive a group of numbers as input and provide functionalities for creating a BST (Binary search tree) from the input, iterate the tree and hard delete the specified number from tree (if exists) and then return sorted tree as result and store input and output as log inside a sql table</br>
The application have only one end point which contain all described processes</br>
The solution is completely support docker and to run the project all you need is docker installed on your machine and run bellow command
```bash
     docker-compose up --build
```
